# Pomodoro-Timer
The Pomodoro Timer is a Python program with a graphical interface built using tkinter. It helps users boost productivity by following the Pomodoro Technique. Users work in 25-min intervals ("pomodoros") with short breaks. The timer auto-switches between work and breaks, fostering focus and time management.
